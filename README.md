All requests have been implemented.
Please note that the request was not 100% clear (my colleagues all agree), and I understood the following:
The application has a daily calorie intake goal. If the computed ideal burndown ratio (daily) is larger than this value,
then the application has detected waste.

Also, I only saw the analysis & design template document after uploading my own take on it. Sorry, I promise I will
use the template next time.
There is a nameless error in pom.xml but it works very well, it's probably just my Eclipse version acting up.
I didn't know a better way to export the database than dumping the structure and data into a .sql file. If there is
a better way, please let me know (sorry).
